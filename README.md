 Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is critical for both fish welfare and worker comfort
 in closed aquaculture facilities. Poor IEQ can cause stress, increase disease risk and
 reduce productivity. However, IEQ is often monitored in a purely reactive way: operators
 respond only after conditions have already degraded.
 The main objective of this project is therefore to design and evaluate a data-driven
 system that can:
 • forecast IEQ variables one hour in advance,
 • use these forecasts to support proactive ventilation and control,
 • andworkunder real operating conditions in a smart aquaculture facility in Morocco.
 The system predicts several IEQ variables simultaneously: temperature, relative hu
midity, CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, and a synthetic IEQ score.
 A second objective is to compare three deep-learning architectures under identical
 conditions:
 • a Long Short–Term Memory network (LSTM),
 • a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN),
 • a Transformer-based model.
 All models receive the same six-hour input window and predict the same one-hour horizon.
 The comparison focuses on accuracy, robustness and ease of deployment.
